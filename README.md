<h3>Wireframe.</h3> 

<h3>Purpose </h3>
As a chef, I want an app track my recipes and ingredients needed so that it is easy to remember.
As a mom, I want to make a task list of chores and everyday things I do. I want a way to remember all the things I do and be able to refer back to it so I don't forget what I have or have not done for the day. <br />
As a student, I need to be able to stay organized and keep track when I finish my assignments or homework. I need to be able to update and revise this list throughout the school term. <br />
As a general user, I want an easy note-taking app that will track small tasks for me. I want to be able to check them off as I complete it and then be able to go back and edit that if I think of small notes that would help complete the task or further details to remember.  <br />

User will need to have the following installed..
<ul>
<li> Node.js </li>

</ul>

<h3>MVP Goals</h3>

<li>Have a 'complete' task list that is able to be reopened for new edits / entries</li>

</ul>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have a 'private' function for list creation with unique password for the list</li>
